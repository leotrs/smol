<h3>Graph Encoding</h3>
<dl>
    <dt id="graph6"><strong>graph6</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        A compact ASCII encoding for simple undirected graphs. Each graph6 string uniquely represents a graph
        (up to isomorphism). The format encodes the upper triangle of the adjacency matrix.
        <br><br>
        <strong>Example:</strong> <code>D?{</code> represents the star graph $K_{1,4}$ (4 leaves connected to a center).

    </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Matrix Types</h3>
<dl>
        <dt id="adjacency"><strong>Adjacency matrix</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            The $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A_{ij} = 1$ if vertices $i$ and $j$ are connected, 0 otherwise.
            Symmetric for undirected graphs. Eigenvalues are real.
        </dd>

        <dt id="kirchhoff"><strong>Kirchhoff Laplacian</strong> (Combinatorial Laplacian)</dt>
        <dd>
            $L = D - A$, where $D$ is the diagonal degree matrix and $A$ is the adjacency matrix.
            Also called the combinatorial or standard Laplacian. Eigenvalues are real and non-negative:
            $0 = \lambda_1 \leq \lambda_2 \leq \cdots \leq \lambda_n \leq 2\Delta$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree.
            The second-smallest eigenvalue $\lambda_2$ is the algebraic connectivity (Fiedler value).
        </dd>

        <dt id="signless"><strong>Signless Laplacian</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            $Q = D + A$, where $D$ is the diagonal degree matrix and $A$ is the adjacency matrix.
            The "positive" counterpart to the Kirchhoff Laplacian. All eigenvalues are real and non-negative.
            Related to chromatic number and bipartiteness detection.
        </dd>

        <dt id="laplacian"><strong>Normalized Laplacian</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            The symmetric normalized Laplacian: $L = I - D^{-1/2} A D^{-1/2}$, where $D$ is the
            diagonal degree matrix. Eigenvalues are real and lie in $[0, 2]$.
            Has the same eigenvalues as the random walk Laplacian $I - D^{-1} A$.
        </dd>

        <dt id="nonbacktracking"><strong>Non-backtracking matrix</strong> (Hashimoto)</dt>
        <dd>
            A $2m \times 2m$ matrix indexed by directed edges. $B_{e \to f} = 1$ if edge $e$ leads into edge $f$ without
            backtracking (the target of $e$ equals the source of $f$, and $f$ is not the reverse of $e$).
            Eigenvalues are generally complex.
        </dd>

        <dt id="nbl"><strong>Non-backtracking Laplacian</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            $L_B = I - D^{-1} B$, where $B$ is the non-backtracking matrix and $D$ is the diagonal matrix
            of out-degrees in the directed edge graph. Represents a random walk on directed edges.
            Eigenvalues are generally complex.
        </dd>

        <dt id="distance"><strong>Distance matrix</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            The $n \times n$ matrix $D$ where $D_{ij}$ is the shortest path length between vertices $i$ and $j$.
            Only defined for connected graphs. Eigenvalues are real. The distance spectrum captures
            structural information about graph diameter and centrality.
        </dd>
    </dl>

<h3>Spectral Concepts</h3>
<dl>
        <dt id="spectrum"><strong>Spectrum</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            The multiset of eigenvalues of a matrix. Two graphs are <em>cospectral</em> if they have
            the same spectrum for a given matrix type.
        </dd>

        <dt id="cospectral"><strong>Cospectral</strong> (isospectral)</dt>
        <dd>
            Two non-isomorphic graphs that share the same spectrum for a particular matrix type.
            Cospectral graphs are indistinguishable by spectral methods using that matrix alone.
        </dd>

        <dt id="spectral-hash"><strong>Spectral hash</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            A 16-character hash of the sorted eigenvalues, used for fast cospectral lookup.
            Two graphs with the same hash have the same spectrum (within numerical precision).
        </dd>

        <dt id="spectral-distance"><strong>Spectral distance</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            A measure of dissimilarity between two spectra, computed using the Earth Mover's Distance
            (Wasserstein metric). For real eigenvalues (adjacency, Kirchhoff, signless, normalized Laplacian),
            this is the 1D Wasserstein distance between sorted eigenvalue sequences. For complex eigenvalues
            (NB, NBL matrices), this is the 2D Wasserstein distance treating eigenvalues as points $(λ_r, λ_i)$
            in the complex plane. A distance of 0 indicates cospectral graphs; smaller distances indicate more
            similar spectra.
        </dd>
    </dl>

<h3>Switching Mechanisms</h3>
<dl>
        <dt id="gm-switching"><strong>GM switching</strong> (Godsil-McKay)</dt>
        <dd>
            A graph operation that preserves the adjacency spectrum using an <em>equitable partition</em>
            and a <em>switching set</em>. Given a graph $G$ with an equitable partition $V = D \cup C_1 \cup \cdots \cup C_k$,
            where $D$ is a switching set, GM switching produces a cospectral mate $H$ by changing which vertices
            in $D$ connect to which vertices in each partition class.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Requirements:</strong>
            <ul style="margin-top: 0.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
                <li>The partition must be <em>equitable</em>: all vertices in the same class have the same number of neighbors in each other class</li>
                <li>Each vertex in the switching set $D$ must connect to all, none, or exactly half of each partition class $C_i$</li>
                <li>The switching operation swaps which half of each class the vertex connects to</li>
            </ul>
            GM switching is one of the most common explanations for adjacency cospectrality, covering approximately
            43% of adjacency-cospectral graphs at $n=9$.
            <br><br>

        <dt id="switching-mechanism"><strong>Switching mechanism</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            A systematic graph operation that preserves the spectrum for some matrix type. Known mechanisms include
            GM switching (adjacency), Seidel switching (adjacency), and various edge-switching operations.
            Understanding which mechanisms explain observed cospectrality is an active area of research.
        </dd>

        <dt id="equitable-partition"><strong>Equitable partition</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            A partition of vertices $V = C_1 \cup C_2 \cup \cdots \cup C_k$ where all vertices in the same class $C_i$
            have the same number of neighbors in each class $C_j$ (including $C_i$ itself). Equitable partitions
            are central to GM switching and other spectral graph theory results.
