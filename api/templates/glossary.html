    <header><h3>Graph Encoding</h3></header>
    <dl>
        <dt id="graph6"><strong>graph6</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            A compact ASCII encoding for simple undirected graphs. Each graph6 string uniquely represents a graph
            (up to isomorphism). The format encodes the upper triangle of the adjacency matrix.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Example:</strong> <code>D?{</code> represents the star graph $K_{1,4}$ (4 leaves connected to a center).

    <header><h3>Matrix Types</h3></header>
    <dl>
        <dt id="adjacency"><strong>Adjacency matrix</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            The $n \times n$ matrix $A$ where $A_{ij} = 1$ if vertices $i$ and $j$ are connected, 0 otherwise.
            Symmetric for undirected graphs. Eigenvalues are real.
        </dd>

        <dt id="laplacian"><strong>Laplacian matrix</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            The symmetric normalized Laplacian: $L = I - D^{-1/2} A D^{-1/2}$, where $D$ is the
            diagonal degree matrix. Eigenvalues are real and lie in $[0, 2]$.
        </dd>

        <dt id="nonbacktracking"><strong>Non-backtracking matrix</strong> (Hashimoto)</dt>
        <dd>
            A $2m \times 2m$ matrix indexed by directed edges. $B_{e \to f} = 1$ if edge $e$ leads into edge $f$ without
            backtracking (the target of $e$ equals the source of $f$, and $f$ is not the reverse of $e$).
            Eigenvalues are generally complex.
        </dd>

        <dt id="nbl"><strong>Non-backtracking Laplacian</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            $L_B = I - D^{-1} B$, where $B$ is the non-backtracking matrix and $D$ is the diagonal matrix
            of out-degrees in the directed edge graph. Represents a random walk on directed edges.
            Eigenvalues are generally complex.

    <header><h3>Spectral Concepts</h3></header>
    <dl>
        <dt id="spectrum"><strong>Spectrum</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            The multiset of eigenvalues of a matrix. Two graphs are <em>cospectral</em> if they have
            the same spectrum for a given matrix type.
        </dd>

        <dt id="cospectral"><strong>Cospectral</strong> (isospectral)</dt>
        <dd>
            Two non-isomorphic graphs that share the same spectrum for a particular matrix type.
            Cospectral graphs are indistinguishable by spectral methods using that matrix alone.
        </dd>

        <dt id="spectral-hash"><strong>Spectral hash</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            A 16-character hash of the sorted eigenvalues, used for fast cospectral lookup.
            Two graphs with the same hash have the same spectrum (within numerical precision).
        </dd>

        <dd>
            A graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects
            a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other. Equivalently, a graph with no odd cycles.

        <dd>
            A graph that can be drawn in the plane without any edges crossing.

        <dd>
            A graph where every vertex has the same degree.
        </dd>

        <dt id="diameter"><strong>Diameter</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            The maximum shortest path distance between any two vertices. Only defined for connected graphs.
        </dd>

        <dt id="girth"><strong>Girth</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            The length of the shortest cycle in the graph. Undefined ($\infty$) for acyclic graphs (trees/forests).
        </dd>

        <dt id="radius"><strong>Radius</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            The minimum eccentricity of any vertex, where eccentricity is the maximum distance from
            that vertex to any other vertex.

        <dt id="clique-number"><strong>Clique number</strong></dt>
        <dd>

        <dt id="chromatic-number"><strong>Chromatic number</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            The minimum number of colors needed to color the vertices such that no two adjacent
            vertices share the same color. SMOL stores a greedy upper bound.

        <dt id="algebraic-connectivity"><strong>Algebraic connectivity</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            The second-smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix (also called the Fiedler value).
            A connected graph has algebraic connectivity $> 0$. Larger values indicate stronger connectivity.
        </dd>

        <dt id="global-clustering"><strong>Global clustering</strong> (transitivity)</dt>
        <dd>
            The ratio of closed triangles to connected triples in the graph:
            $C = \frac{3 \times \text{triangles}}{\text{connected triples}}$.
            Measures the overall tendency of nodes to cluster together.

        <dt id="avg-local-clustering"><strong>Average local clustering</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            The average of local clustering coefficients across all nodes. Each node's local
            clustering coefficient is the fraction of possible triangles through that node that exist.

        <dd>
            The mean shortest path distance between all pairs of vertices.

        <dd>
            Pearson correlation coefficient of degree between connected node pairs.
            Positive values mean high-degree nodes tend to connect to high-degree nodes;
            negative values indicate high-degree nodes connect to low-degree nodes.
        </dd>

        <dt id="betweenness"><strong>Betweenness centrality</strong></dt>
        <dd>
            For each vertex, the fraction of all shortest paths that pass through it.
            SMOL stores the sorted distribution of betweenness values across all vertices.

        <dt id="closeness"><strong>Closeness centrality</strong></dt>
        <dd>
