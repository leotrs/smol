<h3>Graph Encoding</h3>
<dl>
    <dt id="graph6"><strong>graph6</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        A compact ASCII encoding for simple undirected graphs. Each graph6 string uniquely represents a graph
        (up to isomorphism). The format encodes the upper triangle of the adjacency matrix.
        <br>Example: <code>D?{</code> represents the star graph K<sub>1,4</sub> (4 leaves connected to a center).
        <br>See: <a href="https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/data/formats.txt">nauty format specification</a>
    </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Matrix Types</h3>
<dl>
    <dt id="adjacency"><strong>adjacency matrix</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        The n×n matrix A where A[i,j] = 1 if vertices i and j are connected, 0 otherwise.
        Symmetric for undirected graphs. Eigenvalues are real.
    </dd>

    <dt id="laplacian"><strong>laplacian matrix</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        The symmetric normalized Laplacian: L = I - D<sup>-1/2</sup>AD<sup>-1/2</sup>, where D is the
        diagonal degree matrix. Eigenvalues are real and lie in [0, 2].
    </dd>

    <dt id="nonbacktracking"><strong>non-backtracking matrix</strong> (Hashimoto matrix)</dt>
    <dd>
        A 2m×2m matrix indexed by directed edges. B[e→f] = 1 if edge e leads into edge f without
        backtracking (i.e., the target of e equals the source of f, and f is not the reverse of e).
        Eigenvalues are generally complex.
    </dd>

    <dt id="nbl"><strong>non-backtracking laplacian</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        L = I - D<sup>-1</sup>B, where B is the non-backtracking matrix and D is the diagonal matrix
        of out-degrees in the directed edge graph. Represents a random walk on directed edges.
        Eigenvalues are generally complex.
    </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Spectral Concepts</h3>
<dl>
    <dt id="spectrum"><strong>spectrum</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        The multiset of eigenvalues of a matrix. Two graphs are <em>cospectral</em> if they have
        the same spectrum for a given matrix type.
    </dd>

    <dt id="cospectral"><strong>cospectral</strong> (isospectral)</dt>
    <dd>
        Two non-isomorphic graphs that share the same spectrum for a particular matrix type.
        Cospectral graphs are indistinguishable by spectral methods using that matrix.
    </dd>
</dl>

<h3>Graph Properties</h3>
<dl>
    <dt id="bipartite"><strong>bipartite</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        A graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets such that every edge connects
        a vertex in one set to a vertex in the other. Equivalently, a graph with no odd cycles.
    </dd>

    <dt id="planar"><strong>planar</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        A graph that can be drawn in the plane without any edges crossing.
    </dd>

    <dt id="regular"><strong>regular</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        A graph where every vertex has the same degree.
    </dd>

    <dt id="diameter"><strong>diameter</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        The maximum shortest path distance between any two vertices. Only defined for connected graphs.
    </dd>

    <dt id="girth"><strong>girth</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        The length of the shortest cycle in the graph. Undefined (∞) for acyclic graphs (trees/forests).
    </dd>

    <dt id="radius"><strong>radius</strong></dt>
    <dd>
        The minimum eccentricity of any vertex, where eccentricity is the maximum distance from
        that vertex to any other vertex.
    </dd>
</dl>
